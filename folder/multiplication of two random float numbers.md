# Calculate multiplication of 2 random floating numbers                                        (Note:-First random float number must be between 0.1 and 1 ; Second random float number must be between 9.5 and 99.5).


```python
import random

num1  = random.random()
print("First Random float is ", num1)
num2 = random.uniform(9.5, 99.5)
print("Second Random float is ", num2)
num3 = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication is ", num3)
```

    First Random float is  0.558648373725498
    Second Random float is  71.99862783583606
    Multiplication is  40.22191635095719
